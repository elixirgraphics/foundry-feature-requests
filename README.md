# Foundry Feature Requests

To add a feature request, click the `Issues` tab above. You'll then click the "New Issue" button to begin submitting your feature request.

When submitting a request please provide the following information. The more information you can supply the better I can understand your request, and the more likely I am to be able to include it at some point.

- Is this a request for the Foundry suite as a whole or a specific stack within Foundry or its addons? If it is for a specific stack, let me know which stack it is.
- Describe the requested feature in detail. The more deatil the better!
- If you have reference material for a feature, a screenshot, a sketch, something else, please provide that as well.

## Some Notes (please read)

A few notes about feature requests:

- I've pinned a sample feature request to the top of the `Issues` tab. This is a very simple sample, but should help get you started.
- I try to get as many feature requests in as possible. Not everything submitted can or will make it into Foundry. This could be because of technical reasons, or perhaps it just doesn't fit within the bounds of what Foundry is bnuilt to to.
- When submitting a feature request please submit them only for Foundry based stacks. That would be any stack in the main **Foundry** suite, as well as stacks included in the **Potion Pack** and **Thunder Pack** addons. Please _do not_ submit requests for Alloy, or other stacks and themes here.
- I may ask questions of you in reply to your feature request. If so that means I need information from you to be able to understand or narrow down what you're looking for in your request. Please respond to requests for further information. If I don't have enough information about your request I will likely not be able to incorporate it into Foundry.
